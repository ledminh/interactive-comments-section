## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) - For authentication
- [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) - For the database

### What I Learned

In this project, I expanded my skills into full-stack development. I rediscovered backend development, leveraging tools like NextAuth and MongoDB Atlas. NextAuth simplified authentication, while MongoDB refreshed my database knowledge. 

### Continued Development

For future projects, I plan to delve deeper into backend development, particularly focusing on NextAuth and MongoDB. While I used GitHub authentication in this project, I aim to explore other authentication providers. Regarding MongoDB, I intend to learn about schema design and create a more robust database API. Additionally, I may explore GraphQL and other database systems.
