## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [SCSS](https://sass-lang.com/) - For styles
- [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/) - For authentication
- [Mongodb - Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database) - For database


### What I learned

For this project, I decided to make it a fullstack app. I learned backend several years ago but have not built anything meaningful ever since. I just realized things become much easier than before because of all the tools available. I especially love NextAuth. It makes authentication become simple. I use Mongodb to refresh my memory on database.   

### Continued development

For future projects, I want to dig deeper into backend, especially NextAuth and Mongodb. I only used NextAuth's Github authentication on this project, but next time, I will try other providers. For Mongodb, next time, I will learn how to design schema and build a better database's api. I might learn a bit about GraphQL and other database systems.
